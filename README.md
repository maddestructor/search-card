### Prerequisites

- Home Assistant
- [card-tools](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-tools)

### Option 1: HACS (Recommended)

1. Search for "Search Card" in the HACS store
2. Install and follow the HACS prompts

### Option 2: Manual Install

1. Download `search-card.js`
2. Copy it to `config/www/search-card/` (create directory if needed)
3. Add to `ui-lovelace.yaml`:

```yaml
resources:
  - url: /local/search-card/search-card.js?v=0
    type: module
```

### Option 3: Git Install

```bash
# Clone into your www directory
git clone https://github.com/postlund/search-card.git
```

Then add the same resource reference as in Manual Install.

## Configuration

### Basic Example

```yaml
type: custom:search-card
max_results: 10
search_text: "Search entities..."
excluded_domains:
  - automation
```

### Available Options

| Name             | Type     | Default             | Description                                 |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| max_results      | integer  | 10                  | Maximum number of search results to display |
| search_text      | string   | "Type to search..." | Custom placeholder text                     |
| actions          | object   | optional            | Custom action definitions                   |
| included_domains | string[] | optional            | Only show entities from these domains\*     |
| excluded_domains | string[] | optional            | Hide entities from these domains\*          |

\*Note: `included_domains` and `excluded_domains` cannot be used together

### Domain Filtering

The card supports filtering entities by their domains using either `included_domains` or `excluded_domains`.

#### Common Home Assistant Domains

- `light` - Light entities
- `switch` - Switch entities
- `sensor` - Sensor entities
- `binary_sensor` - Binary sensor entities
- `climate` - Climate control entities
- `media_player` - Media player entities
- `automation` - Automation entities
- `script` - Script entities
- `camera` - Camera entities
- `cover` - Cover/blind/garage door entities

#### Examples

Include only lights and switches:

```yaml
type: custom:search-card
included_domains:
  - light
  - switch
```

Exclude automation and script entities:

```yaml
type: custom:search-card
excluded_domains:
  - automation
  - script
```

**Note**: The card will show entities from all available domains in your Home Assistant instance unless you specify domain filters.

### Custom Actions

Actions allow you to define service calls triggered by regex matches. Example:

```yaml
type: custom:search-card
actions:
  - matches: '^toggle (.+\..+)'
    name: "Toggle {1}"
    service: homeassistant.toggle
    service_data:
      entity_id: { 1 }
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Clear browser cache
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Verify card-tools is properly installed
4. Check your configuration syntax

For bug reports, please [create an issue](https://github.com/postlund/search-card/issues) with:

- Your configuration

## Roadmap
